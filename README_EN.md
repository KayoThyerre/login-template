# Auth Template – React + TypeScript

Authentication and dashboard template built with **React**, focused on **clean architecture**, **reusability**, and **real-world project foundations**.

This project was designed to be a **professional starter template**, ideal for freelance projects and scalable applications.

## 🧠 Architectural Decisions

- **React Context API** for global authentication state
- **User object as the source of truth**, not a boolean
- `isAuthenticated` derived from user state
- Lazy state initialization for persistence
- Layouts separated from pages
- Reusable UI components
- Responsiveness designed from the start

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User accesses `/`
2. Clicks **Login**
3. Mock user is created
4. Global state is updated
5. Data is saved to localStorage
6. User is redirected to `/home`
7. Private routes are unlocked
8. Logout clears state and storage
